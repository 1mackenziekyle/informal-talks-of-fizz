## About

The main goal of Informal Talks is to allow students to share ideas, communicate effectively to audiences, and think critically about the outside world. 

Presenting and attending is encouraged and open to anyone. Topics are your choice, but could include technology, philosophy, video games, interesting research, or a personal story.
